# UNSW_NB15
Feature coded UNSW_NB15 intrusion detection data.

All categorical features have been converted to numerical values for neural network and SVM processing. First zip is only the csv files and second zip includes the .arff files for weka. For more information on the feature coding process refer to http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#encoding-categorical-features
